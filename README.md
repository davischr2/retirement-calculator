# This tool helps you estimate whether you're on track for retirement. Enter your current age, savings, annual contributions, and other financial inputs. The calculator will project your savings growth, adjust for inflation, estimate your income from Social Security and other sources, and determine whether you’ll have enough for retirement—or if there’s a shortfall.
